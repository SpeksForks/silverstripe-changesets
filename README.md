## Documentation

This module changes the publishing mechanism for users from being one of single 
page modifications to instead being multiple page modifications being submitted
as a single changeset. This can be considered as somewhat similar to how
a source control management tool such as SVN or Git builds up a changeset
before the user commits them all at once.
